## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install captchai
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```python
from captchai.core.models.config import CaptchaGlobalConfig, AWSProviderConfig, AvailableResolvers

config = CaptchaGlobalConfig(
    groq_api_key="your-groq-api-key",
    moondream_api_key="your-moondream-api-key",
    aws_provider_config=AWSProviderConfig(
        image_size=(640, 640),  # Customize image size
        grid_size=3,  # Grid dimensions
        resolver=AvailableResolvers.GROQ_IMAGE_ONE_SHOOT,
        # Fallback resolvers for resilience
        list_resolver_image_fallback=[
            AvailableResolvers.MOONDREAM_IMAGE_ONE_SHOOT,
            AvailableResolvers.GROQ_IMAGE_ONE_SHOOT,
            AvailableResolvers.GROQ_IMAGE_MULTI_SHOOT,
            AvailableResolvers.MOONDREAM_IMAGE_MULTI_SHOOT
        ]
    )
)
```

## üéØ Available Resolvers

### üñºÔ∏è Image Resolvers
- `GROQ_IMAGE_ONE_SHOOT`: Single-shot solving with Groq
- `GROQ_IMAGE_MULTI_SHOOT`: Multi-shot approach with Groq
- `MOONDREAM_IMAGE_ONE_SHOOT`: Quick Moondream vision model
- `MOONDREAM_IMAGE_MULTI_SHOOT`: Advanced Moondream processing

### üéµ Audio Resolvers
- `GROQ_AUDIO`: Advanced audio CAPTCHA processing

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here's a complete example of how to use Captchai to solve different types of CAPTCHAs:

```python
from captchai import CaptchaSolver
from captchai.core.models.config import (
    CaptchaGlobalConfig,
    AWSProviderConfig,
    AvailableResolvers
)
import base64

def solve_captcha_example():
    # 1. Configure the solver
    config = CaptchaGlobalConfig(
        groq_api_key="your-groq-api-key",
        moondream_api_key="your-moondream-api-key",
        aws_provider_config=AWSProviderConfig(
            resolver=AvailableResolvers.GROQ_IMAGE_ONE_SHOOT,
            grid_size=3,
            image_size=(640, 640)
        )
    )

    # 2. Initialize the solver
    solver = CaptchaSolver(config)

    # 3. Solve different types of CAPTCHAs
    
    # Image CAPTCHA (using base64 string)
    with open("path/to/captcha.png", "rb") as image_file:
        image_base64 = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
    
    # For image CAPTCHAs, query is required - it specifies what type of object to identify
    image_result = solver.solve_aws_captcha_image(
        data=image_base64,
        query="bucket"  # Required: Specify the type of object to identify
    )
    print(f"Image CAPTCHA Solution: {image_result}")

    # Audio CAPTCHA (using base64 string)
    with open("path/to/audio.mp3", "rb") as audio_file:
        audio_base64 = base64.b64encode(audio_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
    
    # For audio CAPTCHAs, query is optional
    audio_result = solver.solve_aws_captcha(
        data=audio_base64
    )
    print(f"Audio CAPTCHA Solution: {audio_result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_captcha_example()
```

> **Note**: For image CAPTCHAs, the `query` parameter is required - it specifies what type of object to identify (e.g., "Select all images with traffic lights", "Select all squares with buses"). For audio CAPTCHAs, the `query` parameter is optional.
